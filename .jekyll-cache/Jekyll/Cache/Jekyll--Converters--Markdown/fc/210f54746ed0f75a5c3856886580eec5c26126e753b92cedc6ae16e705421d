I"ÿ<div>I remember the first time I came across a sad and neglected plant, I had little hope of it's survival. Nonetheless I took it in and cared for it in the faint chance there was still some life left. And life it had! My cathalea ornata bounced back when summer rolled around, bigger and brighter than ever. That really stuck with me. I became obsessed with plants. Tropicals, succulents, annuals; I couldn't get enough of them! 60+ plants and a jungle filled room later, I have learned quite a few things from plants. <br /><br /><div style="padding-left:30px">1. No matter how bleak things seemed, there's always a way to turn it around and life will continue. In a way, the resiliance of plants really touched me and taught me a lot of how I wanted to life my life. We are like the plants. We are stronger than we think. We are not defined by material things, but by our attitude and outlook on life.<br /><br />2. Strive for growth and you'll bloom. Plant's have one goal and that is to grow. If we stop learning and trying to achieve, we'll wilt as well. Whether it's putting energy into your career or learning a new hobby, stepping forward into growth will always pave way for new opportunities. <br /><br /></div>Every day is a new day for plants to thrive and grow. At the end of the day, that's all we're really trying to achieve as well; living each day to the best of our abilities.<br /><br /><div style="font-size:14px">* pictured above is my lovely monstera adansonii from my plant instagram @foliagechaser</div></div>
