description: <div>After spending three long years in university disliking my career choice as an accountant / auditor, I craved to do something that I can see an immediate impact on real world challenges. (That is not to say auditor's arn't superheros, it's just not my cup of tea. So all my auditor friends please put down your pitchforks!). <br><br>I love working on projects that have a direct impact on an industry painpoint. After switching to Computer Science in my third year, I really enjoyed all the work I have done so far. From working on ground breaking advancements in the blockchain industry, to helping healthcare supply chain participants increase workflow efficiency, to using machine learning for better analyzing and predicting malfunction in the rail industry, I have seen the positive impact the projects I've worked on had on both clients and the society as a whole. <br> <br>  Technology itself is focused on breaking new ground and encompasses a culture of movement, growth and advancement. Apart from coming up with solutions, I love being a part of the process to figure out how to make those ideas come to life. Being able to see this impact and be a part of this journey gives me a great sense of satisfaction and accomplishment everyday. </div>
